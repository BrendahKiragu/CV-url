      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a passionate Food Science and Technology graduate from Jomo Kenyatta
        University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT), where I earned a
        Second Class Honors (Upper Division) degree. Over the past two years,
        I’ve immersed myself in the dairy manufacturing industry as a Quality
        Assurance Analyst—testing, refining, and ensuring every product that
        left the line met the highest standards. From analyzing raw milk samples
        to collaborating with production teams to solve quality hiccups, I’ve
        loved the challenge of turning science into safe, consistent, and
        delicious products. I'm now excited to take this hands-on experience and
        team-oriented mindset into a new environment where I can keep growing,
        innovating, and making a difference in the food industry.

      <article>
        <h3>Kinangop Dairy Limited</h3>
        <p class="date">
          Quality Assurance Analyst (June 2023 - May 2024) &ndash; Contract
        </p>
        <p>
          My time at Kinangop Dairy Limited was hands-on, fast-paced, and deeply
          rewarding. I was responsible for sampling and running quality tests on
          both raw and finished dairy products—making sure every drop met our
          safety and quality benchmarks. I also got the chance to work with the
          R&D team, where I joined sensory evaluations and shared structured
          feedback to help shape product development.
        </p>
        <p>
          A big part of my role involved monitoring Critical Control Points and
          keeping detailed process records to uphold both food safety and
          production efficiency. I took pride in ensuring that only top-quality
          packaged products made it through our final inspections. From
          maintaining sanitation records to enforcing cleaning protocols across
          all equipment and workspaces, I understood how each task contributed
          to a safe and consistent end product.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the highlights was assisting with internal audits and helping
          prepare compliance reports—an experience that sharpened my attention
          to detail and deepened my understanding of regulatory requirements in
          the dairy industry.

        <p class="date">
          Quality Assurance Assistant (March 2022 &ndash; May 2023) &ndash;
          Contract
        </p>
        <p>
          I began my journey in quality assurance at Kinangop Dairy Limited as a
          QA Assistant, where I developed a solid foundation in food safety and
          product integrity. My role involved conducting chemical, sensory, and
          physical tests on dairy products to ensure they met both internal
          standards and regulatory requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned to prepare reagents with precision, following recommended
          procedures, and supported the team in daily lab routines that were
          critical to our product consistency. One of my proudest contributions
          was collaborating with the production and engineering departments to
          identify process gaps and introduce corrective measures—efforts that
          directly led to a 20% reduction in product defects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also took initiative in leading training sessions for production
          staff, focusing on hygiene, food safety, and quality control
          practices. These sessions not only improved team awareness but helped
          strengthen our overall compliance culture. Throughout, I maintained
          clear and accurate records of testing, production processes, and
          sanitation—an essential part of keeping our operations transparent and
          audit-ready.
